## The Shiny Application is based on Aa

The Shiny Application used for this example visualizes results from the Urban Institute DYNASIM model. Those visualizations [are hosted on our website](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/program-retirement-policy/projects/dynasim-visualizing-older-americans-future-well-being/fiscal-health-social-security) with their code available [on our GitHub](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/dynasim-shiny1).

That application originally built by Aaron Williams, with modeling done by Karen Smith and Aaron Williams.
